- **Language:** Python
- **Binary Name:** 105torus

## Project Overview üìú

The objective is to solve 4th degree equations of the form: a4x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x^1 + a0 = 0, using iterative algorithms. The project focuses on three methods:

- The bisection method,
- Newton‚Äôs method,
- The secant method.

### Usage

`./105torus opt a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 n`


#### DESCRIPTION
- `opt`: Method option (1 for bisection, 2 for Newton, 3 for secant).
- `a[0-4]`: Coefficients of the equation.
- `n`: Precision (the application of the polynomial to the solution should be smaller than 10^-n).

### Examples

#### Example 1

`Input: ./105torus 1 -1 0 6 -5 1 6`<br>

`Output: Bisection method iterations and solution.`<br>

#### Example 2

`Input: ./105torus 2 -1 0 6 -5 1 12`<br>

`Output: Newton‚Äôs method iterations and solution.`<br>


*Note: Precision in calculations is crucial for the accuracy of the solution.*
